[French version](README.fr.md)

This program was made during my Secondary 5 (Grade 11) for my personal project at my IB school.<br>
This application is used to import your calendar from the Mozaik Portal (Web app used by most of public school in Quebec) into Google Calendar.<br>
This software aims to help students and teachers in their time management while allowing them to have their professional and personal calendar in the same place.

1- Download the latest version of the program in the Release section<br>
2- Extract the file<br>
3- Launch jdk-21.exe for installing the correct Java version<br>
4- Launch the file launch.bat<br>
5- Sign into your Mozaik account<br>
6- Sign into your Google account<br>
7- Follow the steps on the screen<br>
8- Enjoy!<br>

There is also a video showing me using the program on YouTube: <https://youtu.be/jWplsnjWNzA>



FAQ:<br>
1- Does CSES collect information?<br>
No, the CSES program only uses information essential to the program (for example, course information). This information is only saved on your computer during the program execution. So, I do not have access to any of your information. Also, my app has been verified by Google
